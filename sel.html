      <h2><b>Self Care First</b></h2>
      <p>Your body is divine</p>
      <p>
        This page is about self-care routine. Self-care is not about makeup or beauty standards.
        It's about embracing ourselves and loving who we are by taking care of our body and mind.
        Self-care is the deliberate practice of nurturing your physical, mental, and emotional well-being. It involves taking time to engage in activities that make you feel good, whether it's something as simple as a relaxing bath or a walk in nature, or something more structured like practicing mindfulness or meditation. The goal is to prioritize your needs and create a healthy balance in your life, ultimately leading to improved overall health and well-being.
        <b>Here's a more detailed look at what self-care encompasses:</b>
<b>Physical Well-being:</b>
This includes things like getting enough sleep, eating healthy, exercising regularly, and practicing good hygiene. 
<b>Mental and Emotional Well-being:</b>
This involves engaging in activities that help you manage stress, reduce anxiety, and improve your mood, such as spending time with loved ones, practicing mindfulness, or pursuing hobbies. 
<b>Social and Spiritual Well-being:</b>
This can involve connecting with others, practicing gratitude, or engaging in activities that bring a sense of purpose and meaning. 
In essence, self-care is about recognizing your needs and actively taking steps to meet them, regardless of how big or small those steps may be. It's a practice that can make a significant difference in your overall well-being and quality of life.
